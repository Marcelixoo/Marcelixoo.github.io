After spending too much time  talking to myself, I finally took the initiative to start blogging.
The biggest force blocking me from taking this step was the lack of intention.
What would I blog about? Why should I consider my own thoughts important to be shared?
Those, and some other questions, bogged me down for a long, long time.

It was only yesterday, after facing a huge announcement from my partner, that I was able to gather my strenght and take the first step.
I am moving to Berlin in a few weeks to start a new bachelor degree in Software Engineering.
And, since yesterday, my partner decided to join me on that.
She will take a break from her school to spend a year in Berlin translating essential books written in other languages to German.

I can't express how excited I am to start it all over.
However, at the same time, I can't hide away my fear of all that's to come.
